## Introduction
cLoops2 is an extension of our previous work, [cLoops](https://github.com/YaqiangCao/cLoops). From loop-calling based on assumption-free clustering to a full suite of analysis tools for 3D genomic interaction data, cLoops2 has been adapted specifically for data such as Hi-TrAC/Trac-looping/ChIA-PET/HiChIP, for which interactions are enriched over the genome through experimental steps. cLoops2 still supports Hi-C -like data. The changes from cLoops to cLoops2 are designed to address challenges around aiming for higher resolutions with the next-generation of genome architecture mapping technologies. 

cLoops2 is designed with respect reference to [bedtools](https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Samtools](http://www.htslib.org/) for command-line style programming. If you have experience with them, you will find cLoops2 easy and efficient to use and combine commands, integrate as steps in your processing pipeline. 

Please refer to our [Hi-TrAC method manuscript(in prepration)]() or [cLoops2 manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.20.453068v1) for what cLoops2 can do and show. 

If you use cLoops2 in your research (the idea, the algorithm, the analysis scripts or the supplemental data), please give us a star on the GitHub repo page and cite our paper as follows:

## Basic Usage and Quick Guide
### Example data background introduction 
Example data for testing is available at [cLoops2/example/data](https://github.com/YaqiangCao/cLoops2/blob/master/example/data). The BEDPE files were from Hi-TrAC experiments mapped to hg38 for chromosome 21 in GM12878 and K562 cell lines, two biological replicates for each cell line. Only intra-chromosomal PETs were kept. Raw FASTQ reads were processed by [tracPre2.py](https://github.com/YaqiangCao/cLoops2/blob/master/scripts/tracPre2.py).       

For other kinds of 3D genomic interaction data such as ChIA-PET, Hi-C, and HiChIP, cLoops2 can also start with provided BEDPE files.     

The following example command lines were also recorded in [cLoops2/example/test\_run/run.sh](https://github.com/YaqiangCao/cLoops2/blob/master/example/test_run/run.sh), which can be used to test the main programs of cLoops2 after installation.    


### Rountine analysis step 1: get basic statistics of PETs from input BEDPE file
```
cLoops2 qc -f ../data/GM_Trac1_hg38_chr21_partaa.bedpe.gz,../data/GM_Trac1_hg38_chr21_partab.bedpe.gz -o test -p 2
```    

Please note, in cLoops2, multiple files/directories can be assigned as input with the separation of the comma, please do not leave blanks between names. The majority of cLoops2 analysis modules can be run in a parallel way with the option of **-p**. Most of them will generate a cLoops2.log file recording the program parameters and important messages for later review. 

The informative output is a .txt file with annotation of information as follows.

### Rountine analysis step 2: pre-process BEDPE file(s) into cLoops2 data
```
#get directory seperately for GM12878, only target chromosome chr21
cLoops2 pre -f ../data/GM_HiTrac_bio1.bedpe.gz -o gm_bio1 -c chr21
cLoops2 pre -f ../data/GM_HiTrac_bio2.bedpe.gz -o gm_bio2 -c chr21 
#get the combined data for GM12878
cLoops2 pre -f ../data/GM_HiTrac_bio1.bedpe.gz,../data/GM_HiTrac_bio2.bedpe.gz -o gm -c chr21
#get the directory seperately for K562 first
cLoops2 pre -f ../data/K562_HiTrac_bio1.bedpe.gz -o k562_bio1 -c chr21
cLoops2 pre -f ../data/K562_HiTrac_bio2.bedpe.gz -o k562_bio2 -c chr21
#then combine the data, only keep 1 PET for the same position, default the same to cLoops2 pre
cLoops2 combine -ds k562_bio1,k562_bio2 -o k562 -keep 1
```
The output directory contains one [.json](https://github.com/YaqiangCao/cLoops2/blob/master/example/gm/petMeta.json) file for the basic PET statistics and [.ixy](#.ixy) files, which are used to call peaks, loops, or any analysis implemented in cLoops2.          

For data backup/sharing purposes, the directory can be saved as a .tar.gz file through ***tar*** command.    

If you move the directory or change the files in the directory, please run ***cLoops2 update*** to update the information of petMeta.json, as all ixy files were recorded as absolute paths. 

### Rountine analysis step 3: estimate reasonable contact matrix resolution    
```
cLoops2 estRes -d gm -o gm -bs 5000,1000,200 -p 10
cLoops2 estRes -d k562 -o k562 -bs 5000,1000,200 -p 10
```
This step is not needed for peak-calling 1D data such as ChIP-seq or ChIC-seq.     

We prefer to use the highest resolution with >=50% PETs (solid lines) for filtering singletons, visualization, or calling loops. Dash lines show the bins with only singleton PETs, evenly distributed so increased stably, higher possibilities of noises. 

The main output is a figure as follows.

<p align="center">
<img align="center" width="400" height="275" src="https://github.com/YaqiangCao/cLoops2/blob/master/pngs/gm_estRes.png">
</p>   

### Rountine analysis step 4: estimate significant interaction distance limitation    
```
cLoops2 estDis -d gm -o gm -bs 1000 -p 10 -plot
```

The main output is a figure as follows. The plot indicates Hi-TrAC data may detect significant interactions within 1MB. 

<p align="center">
<img align="center" width="400" height="275" src="https://github.com/YaqiangCao/cLoops2/blob/master/pngs/gm_obsExpDisFreq_obsExp.png">
</p>   


### Rountine analysis step 5: estimate similarities/consistency among replicates 
```
cLoops2 estSim -ds gm_bio1,gm_bio2,gm,k562_bio1,k562_bio2,k562 -bs 1000 -plot -p 6 -o test_step4
```
<p align="center">
<img align="center" width="400" height="350" src="https://github.com/YaqiangCao/cLoops2/blob/master/pngs/test_step4_PCC.png">
</p>   


### Rountine analysis step 6:  call peaks    
Call peaks can be run on raw data or filtered data (through ***cLoops2 filterPETs***), only using PETs within 1kb. Smaller eps, sharper peaks. Run as PETs or split PETs as single-end reads. 

```
cLoops2 callPeaks -d gm -o gm -eps 50,100 -minPts 10 -mcut 1000 -split 
```

The main output is a [\_peaks.txt](#_peaks.txt) file, from which contains all important informations for peaks.   

### Rountine analysis step 7: show aggregated peaks 
Check global peaks width and enrichment through aggregation plot. For Hi-TrAC data, we expect high enrichment of signals at peaks.
```
cLoops2 agg -d gm -peaks gm_peaks.bed -o gm -peak_ext 2500 -peak_bins 200 -peak_norm -skipZeros
```
<p align="center">
<img align="center" width="200" height="500" src="https://github.com/YaqiangCao/cLoops2/blob/master/pngs/gm_aggPeaks.png">
</p>

### Rountine analysis step 8: call intra-chromosomal loops     
Call loops can be run on raw data or filtered data.    

```
#call intra-chromosomal loops, filtered PETs can be used to show clear view of loops, or futhur to call loops
cLoops2 callLoops -d gm -o gm -eps 200,500,1000 -minPts 10 -w -j 
```

The main output is a [\_loops.txt](#_loops.txt) file, which contains all important information for loops.   

We implemented a trans-chromosomal-loops-caller in ***cLoops callLoops*** with a parameter of ***-trans***. However, we do not recommend running with this option for Hi-TrAC data. 

With the options of ***-w -j***, loops can be output as the input of the washU genome browser and juicebox. 

If too many close loops are called, with the option of ***-max_cut***, the maximal distance cutoff for self-ligation PETs vs inter-ligation PETs will be used to filter loops. Also, with the option of ***-cut***, only long-distance PETs will be used to call loops. 

With the option of ***-hic***, callLoops will not check the peak-like feature for anchors, more compatible for Hi-C like data.  

Because in cLoops2 the backend clustering algorithm is different from that of cLoops, so even the same parameter may have different results. 

### Rountine analysis step 9: show aggregated loops 
```
cLoops2 agg -d gm -o gm -loops gm_loops.txt -bws ../data/GM12878_ATAC_chr21.bw,../data/GM12878_CTCF_chr21.bw -1D -loop_norm

```
<p align="center">
<img align="center" width="300" height="500" src="https://github.com/YaqiangCao/cLoops2/blob/master/pngs/gm_aggLoops.png">
</p>

For Hi-TrAC, we expect the aggregated loops pattern as above: 
- highly enriched signal at the center for loop regions; 
- relative higher signal from the two anchors, as for Hi-TrAC, anchors are expected to be peaks in the 1D.

### Rountine analysis step 10: call domains 
```
cLoops2 callDomains -d gm -o gm -bs 5000 -ws 100000,250000
```

The main output is a [\_domains.txt](#_domains.txt) file. 

For Hi-TrAC, called domains are all activate domains. There is a ***-hic*** option for Hi-C like data.

### Rountine analysis step 11: show aggregated domains
```
#convert the output segregation score from bedGraph file to bigWig
bedGraphToBigWig  gm_domains_SS_binSize5.0k_winSize100.0k.bdg ../../data/hg38.chrom.sizes gm_domains_SS_bs5k_ws100k.bw
bedGraphToBigWig  gm_domains_SS_binSize5.0k_winSize250.0k.bdg ../../data/hg38.chrom.sizes gm_domains_SS_bs5k_ws250k.bw
cLoops2 agg -d gm -o gm -domains gm_domains.bed -bws ../data/GM12878_CTCF_chr21.bw,gm_domains_SS_bs5k_ws100k.bw,gm_domains_SS_bs5k_ws250k.bw -1D 
```

<p align="center">
<img align="center" width="500" height="600" src="https://github.com/YaqiangCao/cLoops2/blob/master/pngs/gm_aggDomains.png">

For Hi-TrAC, we expect the aggregated domains pattern as above (maybe better clear if there are more domains):
- clear segregation from up-and down-stream;   
- enriched CTCF/Cohesin bindings at boundaries;   
- higher 1D signal than nearby regions;   
- small domains.  

### Rountine analysis step 12: visualization 
***cLoops2 plot*** can show the interaction contact matrix (observed, observed/expected, correlation) at any resolution, with genes (-gtf option), 1D annotations (-bws option), domains (-dominas option), loops (-loops option).

#### a.show big regions such as domains
```
cLoops2 plot -f ./gm/chr21-chr21.ixy -o gm_domain_example -bs 5000 -start 35830000 -end 36950000 -domains gm_domains.bed -log -bws ../data/GM12878_CTCF_chr21.bw -1D -corr
```
<p align="center">
<img align="center" width="400" height="500" src="https://github.com/YaqiangCao/cLoops2/blob/master/pngs/gm_domain_example_matrix.png">
</p>    

#### b.show small regions such as peaks and loops
```
#show enhancer-promoter loops
cLoops2 plot -f gm/chr21-chr21.ixy -o gm_example -bs 500 -start 38752604 -end 38839334 -triu -bw ../data/GM12878_ATAC_chr21.bw,../data/GM12878_CTCF_chr21.bw -1D -loops gm_loops.txt -beds ../data/GM12878_RoadMap_hg38_Enh_chr21.bed,../data/GM12878_RoadMap_hg38_Tss_chr21.bed,gm_peaks.bed -m obs -log -gtf ../data/gencode_v30_chr21.gtf -vmax 1
```    

<p align="center">
<img align="center" width="350" height="700" src="https://github.com/YaqiangCao/cLoops2/blob/master/pngs/gm_example_matrix.png">
</p>

The raw data can be further filtered by loops (or peaks) to show much better view. 
```
cLoops2 filterPETs -d gm -loops gm_loops.txt -o gm_filtered
cLoops2 plot -f gm_filtered/chr21-chr21.ixy -o gm_filtered_example -bs 500 -start 38752604 -end 38839334 -triu -loops gm_loops.txt -log -1D
```

<p align="center">
<img align="center" width="350" height="400" src="https://github.com/YaqiangCao/cLoops2/blob/master/pngs/gm_filtered_example_matrix.png">
</p>

For close loops, we also recommend to use -arch mode, to show raw PETs as arches for called loops. Better for checking the anchor locations and interaction densities compared to nearby backgroud.   
```
cLoops2 plot -f gm_filtered/chr21-chr21.ixy -o gm_example -start 46228500 -end 46290000 -1D -loops gm_loops.txt -arch -aw 0.05
```
<p align="center">
<img align="center" width="600" height="500" src="https://github.com/YaqiangCao/cLoops2/blob/master/pngs/gm_example_arches.png">
</p>


### Rountine analysis step 13: call differential enriched loops for two conditions
```
#a. sampling PETs to same/similar depth to call loops with same parameters
cLoops2 samplePETs -d gm -o gm_samp -tot 780000
cLoops2 samplePETs -d k562 -o k562_samp -tot 780000
#b. call loops with same parameters
cLoops2 callLoops -d gm_samp -o gm_samp -eps 200,500,1000 -minPts 10 -w -j
cLoops2 callLoops -d k562_samp -o k562_samp -eps 200,500,1000 -minPts 10 -w -j
#c. call differentially enriched loops
cLoops2 callDiffLoops -tloop gm_samp_loops.txt -td gm_samp -cloop k562_samp_loops.txt -cd k562_samp -o gm_vs_k562 -j -w 
```

The main output is a [\_dloops.txt](#_dloops.txt) file with three figures. The most import figure shows the aggregated features of called common and specific loops. 

<p align="center">
<img align="center" width="750" height="400" src="https://github.com/YaqiangCao/cLoops2/blob/master/pngs/gm_vs_k562_diffAggLoops.png">
</p>

### Rountine analysis step 14: convert cLoops2 data to others  
More formats will be added if actually needed.  
#### 1. to BED file 
```
cLoops2 dump -d gm -o gm -bed 
```
#### 2. to BEDPE file 
```
cLoops2 dump -d gm -o gm -bedpe

```
#### 7. to TXT file of contact matrix
```
cLoops2 dump -d gm -mat -o gm -mat_res 10000 -mat_chrom chr21-chr21 -mat_start 36000000 -mat_end 40000000 -log -norm -corr
```

### Rountine analysis step 15: quantify features from cLoops2 data
#### 1. quantify GM12878 peaks in K562 data
```
cLoops2 quant -d k562 -peaks gm_peaks.bed -o k562_gm 
```
#### 2. quantify GM12878 loops in K562 data
```
cLoops2 quant -d k562 -loops gm_loops.txt -o k562_gm
```
#### 3. quantify GM12878 domains in K562 data
```
#key parameteres of -bs and -ws from cLoops2 callDomains needed
cLoops2 quant -d k562 -domains gm_domains.txt -o k562_gm -domain_bs 5000 -domain_ws 100000
```

### Rountine analysis step 16: montage analysis of interactions among distal genomic regions 
#### 1. show all interactions among enhancers and promoters 
```
cLoops2 montage -f ./gm_samp/chr21-chr21.ixy -bed ../data/runx1.bed -o gm_runx1_all -ext 2 -simple -ppmw 0.05 -vmax 500 
cLoops2 montage -f ./k562_samp/chr21-chr21.ixy -bed ../data/runx1.bed -o k562_runx1_all -ext 2 -simple -ppmw 0.05 -vmax 500
```

#### 2. show interactions for slected view points, such as one enhancer and promoter
```
cLoops2 montage -f ./gm_samp/chr21-chr21.ixy -bed ../data/runx1.bed -o gm_runx1_vp -ext 2 -simple -ppmw 0.05 -vmax 500 -vp Promoter,E19

### Rountine analysis step 17: annotate loops to genes and find a gene's all interacting enhancers  
```
cLoops2 anaLoops -loop gm_loops.txt -o gm_loops -gtf ../data/gencode_v30_chr21.gtf -net
```
There will be 5 files for the ***-gtf -net*** option as following. 
- [\_LoopsGtfAno.txt](#_LoopsGtfAno.txt) file for main annotations. Loop anchors were assigned to gene promoters and enhancers based on distance. If only run with ***-gtf*** option, this file is the only result. 
- [\_mergedAnchors.txt](#_mergedAnchors.txt) file for merged anchors. There will also be a \_nergedAnchors.bed file converted as bed file for convenience loading to genome browser. 
- [\_loop2anchors.txt](#_loop2anchors.txt) file for loops to merged anchors. 
- [\_targets.txt](#_targets.txt) file for every promoter's interacting enhancer and promoter. If there are >=2 enhancers/promoters linked, [HITS algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HITS_algorithm) will be used to find the hubs. Montage analysis can be followed to show interactions for a specific promoter. 
- \_ep\_net.sif: [SIF file](https://cytoscape.org/manual/Cytoscape2_6Manual.html#SIF%20Format) for interactions networks of annotated enhancers and promoters, can be loaded in Cytoscape for visualization. Can be further used to analyze the topological structures of enhancers and promoters.

              samples can be assigned as -f A.bedpe.gz,B.bedpe.gz,C.bedpe.gz.
```

------
### 2. Pre-process BEDPE into cLoops2 data
Run **cLoops2 pre -h** to see details. 
```
Preprocess mapped PETs into cLoops2 data files.

Support input file formats:
BEDPE: https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/general-usage.html 
PAIRS: https://pairtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/formats.html#pairs

The output directory contains one .json file for the basic statistics of PETs 
information and .ixy files which are coordinates for every PET. The coordinate
files will be used to call peaks, loops or any other analyses implemented in 
cLoops2. For data backup/sharing purposes, the directory can be saved as 
.tar.gz file through tar. If changed and moved location, run 
***cLoops2 update -d*** to update.

Examples:
    1. keep high quality PETs of chromosome chr21
        cLoops2 pre -f trac_rep1.bepee.gz,trac_rep2.bedpe.gz -o trac -c chr21

    2. keep all cis PETs that have distance > 1kb
        cLoops2 pre -f trac_rep1.bedpe.gz,trac_rep2.bedpe.gz -o trac -mapq 0

                        version of cLoops2.
  -f FNIN               Input BEDPE or PAIR file(s), .bedpe and .bedpe.gz are both suitable.
                        Replicates or multiple samples can be assigned as -f A.bedpe.gz,
                        B.bedpe.gz,C.bedpe.gz to get merged PETs.
  -c CHROMS             Argument to process limited set of chromosomes, specify it as chr1,
                        chr2,chr3. Use this option to filter reads from such as
                        chr22_KI270876v1. The default setting is to use the entire set of
                        chromosomes from the data.
  -trans                Whether to parse trans- (inter-chromosomal) PETs. The default is to
                        ignore trans-PETs. Set this flag to pre-process all PETs.
  -mapq MAPQ            MAPQ cutoff to filter raw PETs, default is >=10. This option is not

the .ixy **absolute paths** and other information. So if the directory is 
moved, or some .ixy files are removed or changed, this command is needed to 
update the paths, otherwise the other analysis modules will not work.

Example:
    cLoops2 update -d ./Trac
    

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -d PREDIR   Assign data directory generated by cLoops2 pre to carry out analysis. 
  -o FNOUT    Output data directory / file name prefix, default is cLoops2_output.
  -p CPU      CPUs used to run the job, default is 1, set -1 to use all CPUs
              available. Too many CPU could cause out-of-memory problem if there are
              too many PETs.
  -cut CUT    Distance cutoff to filter cis PETs, only keep PETs with distance
              >=cut. Default is 0, no filtering.
  -mcut MCUT  Keep the PETs with distance <=mcut. Default is -1, no filtering.
  -v          Show cLoops2 verison number and exit.
  ---         Following are sub-commands specific options. This option just show
              version of cLoops2.
```

### 4. Convert cLoops2 data to others    
Run **cLoops2 dump -h** to see details.   
```
Convert cLoops2 data files to other types. Currently supports BED file,BEDPE 
file, HIC file, washU long-range track, 1D signal bedGraph file, matrix txt 
file and virtual 4C signal bedGraph file. 

Converting cLoops2 data to .hic file needs "juicer_tools pre" in the command
line enviroment. 
Converting cLoops2 data to legacy washU browser long-range track needs bgzip
and tabix. Format reference: http://wiki.wubrowse.org/Long-range. 
Converting cLoops2 data to UCSC bigInteract track needs bedToBigBed. Format 
reference: https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/interact.html.
Converting cLoops2 data to bedGraph track will normalize value as RPM 
(reads per million). Run with -bdg_pe flag for 1D data such as ChIC-seq,
ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq. 
Converting cLoops2 data to matrix txt file will need specific resolution. 
The output txt file can be loaded in TreeView for visualization or further
analysis. 
Converting cLoops2 data to virtual 4C signal will need the region of view point
such as a specific promoter or enhancer. The output .bdg file can be loaded in 
IGV or other genome browser for visualization.

### 5. Estimate eps
Run **cLoops2 estEps -h** to see details. 
```
Estimate key parameter eps. 

Two methods are implemented: 1) unsupervised Gaussian mixture model (gmm), and 
2) k-distance plot (k-dis,-k needed). Gmm is based on the assumption that PETs 
can be classified into self-ligation (peaks) and inter-ligation (loops). K-dis
is based on the k-nearest neighbors distance distribution to find the "knee", 
which is where the distance (eps) between neighbors has a sharp increase along
the k-distance curve. K-dis is the traditional approach literatures, but it is
much more time consuming than gmm, and maybe only fit to small cases. If both 
methods do not give nice plots, please turn to the empirical parameters you 
like, such as 100,200 for ChIP-seq -like data, 5000,1000 for Hi-C and etc.

Examples: 
    1. estimate eps with Gaussian mixture model    
        cLoops2 estEps -d trac -o trac_estEps_gmm -p 10 -method gmm

    2. estimate eps with k-nearest neighbors distance distribution
        cLoops2 estEps -d trac -o trac_estEps_kdis -p 10 -method k-dis -k 5
    

optional arguments:

### 6. Estimate reasonable contact matrix resolution 
Run **cLoops2 estRes -h** to see details. 
```
Estimate reasonable genome-wide contact matrix resolution based on signal 
enrichment. 

PETs will be assigned to contact matrix bins according to input resolution. A 
bin is marked as [nx,ny], and a PET is assigned to a bin by nx = int((x-s)/bs),
ny = int((y-s)/bs), where s is the minimal coordinate for all PETs and bs is 
the bin size. Self-interaction bins (nx=ny) will be ignored. The bins only 
containing singleton PETs are assumed as noise. 

The output is a PDF plot, for each resolution, a line is separated into two 
parts: 1) dash line indicated linear increased trend of singleton PETs/bins; 2)
solid thicker line indicated non-linear increased trend of higher potential 
signal PETs/bins. The higher the ratio of signal PETs/bins, the easier it it to
find loops in that resolution. The closer to the random line, the higher the 
possibility to observe evenly distributed signals.  

We expect the highest resolution with >=50% PETs are not singletons.

Example:
    cLoops2 estRes -d trac -o trac -bs 10000,5000,1000 -p 20

### 8. Filter PETs    
Run **cLoops2 filterPETs -h** to see details 
```
Filter PETs according to peaks/domains/loops/singletons/KNNs. 

If any end of the PETs overlap with features such as peaks or loops, the PET 
will be kept. Filtering can be done before or after peak/loop-calling. Input 
can be peaks or loops, but should not be be mixed. The -singleton mode is based
on a specified contact matrix resolution, if there is only one PET in the bin, 
the singleton PETs will be filtered. The -knn is based on noise removing step 
of blockDBSCAN. 

Examples:
    1. keep PETs overlapping with peaks
        cLoops2 filterPETs -d trac -peaks peaks.bed -o trac_filtered

    2. keep PETs that do not overlap with any blacklist regions
        cLoops2 filterPETs -d trac -peaks bg.bed -o trac_filtered -iv

    3. keep PETs that overlap with loop anchors
        cLoops2 filterPETs -d trac -loops test_loops.txt -o trac_filtered

    4. keep PETs that both ends overlap with loop anchors
        cLoops2 filterPETs -d trac -loops test_loops.txt -o trac_filtered -both

    5. keep non-singleton PETs based on 1kb contact matrix

Run **cLoops2 samplePETs -h** to see details.
```
Sampling PETs to target total size. 

If there are multiple sample libraries and the total sequencing depths vary a 
lot, and you want to compare the data fairly, it's better to sample them to 
similar total PETs (either down-sampling or up-sampling), then call peaks/loops
with the same parameters. 

Example:
    cLoops2 samplePETs -d trac -o trac_sampled -tot 5000000 -p 10
    

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -d PREDIR   Assign data directory generated by cLoops2 pre to carry out analysis.

### 10. Call peaks for 1D or 3D data
Run **cLoops2 callPeaks -h** to see details.
```
Call peaks based on clustering. 

Well tested work for ChIP-seq, ChIC-seq, ATAC-seq, CUT&RUN -like or the 3D
genomic data such as Hi-TrAC/Trac-looping, ChIA-PET and HiChIP.

There are three steps in the algorithm: 1) cluster the PETs to find 
self-ligation clusters, which are candidate peaks; 2) estimate the significance
of candidate peaks with local background; 3) if given control data, further 
compare candidate peaks to control data. If running multiple clusterings with
separated parameters, the clusters will be combined and callPeaks will output 
the most significant one based on overlaps. 

Key parameters are -eps and -minPts, both are key parameters in the clustering
algorithm blockDBSCAN. Eps indicates the distance that define two points (PETs) 
being neighbors, while minPts indicatess the minial number of points required 
for a cluster to form.  For sharp-peak like data (ATAC-seq, TF ChIC-seq), set
-eps small such as 100 or 150. For broad-peak like data, such as H3K27me3 
ChIP-seq and ChIC-seq, set -eps large as 500 or 1000. 

Eps will affect more than minPts for sensitivity.

Examples:
    1. call peaks for Trac-looping  
        cLoops2 callPeaks -d trac -eps 100 -minPts 10 -o trac -p 10

    2. call peaks for sharp-peak like ChIC-seq without control data
        cLoops2 callPeaks -d ctcf_chic -o ctcf_chic -p 10

    3. call peaks for broad-peak like ChIC-seq with IgG as control
        cLoops2 callPeaks -d H3K27me3 -bgd IgG -eps 500,1000 -minPts 10 \
                          -o H3K27me3 

    4. call peaks for sharp-peak ChIC-seq with linear fitting scaled control 
       data
        cLoops2 callPeaks -d ctcf -bgd IgG -eps 150 -minPts 10 -o ctcf -p 10\
                          -bgm lf

    5. call peaks with sentitive mode to get comprehensive peaks for CUT&TAG
        cLoops2 callPeaks -d H3K27ac -bgd IgG -sen -p 10

    6. filter PETs first and then call peaks for H3K27ac HiChIP, resulting much
       much accurate peaks
        cLoops2 filterPETs -d h3k27ac_hichip -o h3k27ac_hichip_filtered -knn \
                           -eps 500 -minPts 5
        cLoops2 callPeaks -d h3k27ac_hichip_filtered -eps 200,500 -minPts 10 \
                          -p 10

    7. call peaks for interaction data as single-end data 
        cLoops2 callPeaks -d h3k27ac -o h3k27ac -split -eps 200,500 -minPts 10 \
                          -p 10

    8. call differential peaks between WT and KO condition
        cLoops2 callPeaks -d MLL4_WT -bgd MLL4_KO -o MLL4_WTvsKO -p 10
        cLoops2 callPeaks -d MLL4_KO -bgd MLL4_WT -o MLL4_KOvsWT -p 10
    

optional arguments:
  -h, --help          show this help message and exit
  -d PREDIR           Assign data directory generated by cLoops2 pre to carry out analysis. 
  -o FNOUT            Output data directory / file name prefix, default is cLoops2_output.
  -p CPU              CPUs used to run the job, default is 1, set -1 to use all CPUs
                      available. Too many CPU could cause out-of-memory problem if there are
                      too many PETs.
  -cut CUT            Distance cutoff to filter cis PETs, only keep PETs with distance
                      >=cut. Default is 0, no filtering.
  -mcut MCUT          Keep the PETs with distance <=mcut. Default is -1, no filtering.
  -v                  Show cLoops2 verison number and exit.
  ---                 Following are sub-commands specific options. This option just show
                      version of cLoops2.
  -eps EPS            Distance that defines two points (PETs) being neighbors, eps in
                      blockDBSCAN as key parameter, multiple eps can be assigned such as
                      100,200,300 to run multiple clusterings, the results will be combined.
                      For callPeaks, the default is 100,200. If the data show much more broad
                      feature such as H3K27me3 and H3K4me1, increase it to 500,1000 or larger.
                      If expecting both narrow and broad peaks in the data, set -eps 100,200,
                      500,1000.
  -minPts MINPTS      Points required in a cluster, minPts in blockDBSCAN, key parameter,
                      multiple minPts can be assigned such as 3,5 to run multiple
                      clusterings, the results will be combined. For callPeaks, the default
                      is 5. If the data have many reads, increasing minPts such as 10,20.
  -pcut PCUT          Bonferroni corrected poisson p-value cutoff to determine significant
                      peaks. Default is 1e-2.
  -bgd BGD            Assign control data (IgG, Input) directory generated by cLoops2 pre to
                      carry out analysis. Default is no background.
  -bgm {ratio,lf}     How to scale the target data with control data. Available options are
                      'ratio' and 'lf'. 'ratio' is based on library size and 'lf' means
                      linear fitting for control and target candidate peaks nearby regions.
                      Default is 'lf'. The scaling factor estimated by lf usually is a little
                      larger than ratio. In other words, the higher the scaling factor, the
                      less sensitive the results.
  -pseudo PSEUDO      Pseudo counts for local background or control data to estimate the
                      significance of peaks if no PETs/reads in the background. Default is
                      1. Set it larger for noisy data, 0 is recommend for very clean data
                      such as well prepared CUT&Tag.
  -sen                Whether to use sensitive mode to call peaks. Default is not. If only a
                      few peaks were called, while a lot more can be observed
                      from visualization, try this option. Adjust -pcut or filter by
                      yourself to select significant ones.
  -split              Whether to split paired-end as single end data to call peaks. Sometimes
                      works well for Trac-looping and HiChIP.
  -splitExt SPLITEXT  When run with -split, the extension to upstraem and downstream, 
                      default is 50.

### 11. Call loops
Run **cLoops2 callLoops -h** to see details.
```
Call loops based on clustering. 

Well tested work for Hi-TrAC/TrAC-looping, HiCHiP, ChIA-PET and Hi-C.

Similar to call peaks, there are three main steps in the algorithm: 1) cluster 
the PETs to find inter-ligation clusters, which are candidate loops; 2) 
estimate the significance of candidate loops with permutated local background. 
3) If -hic option not selected, the loop anchors will be checked for peak-like 
features, only peak-like anchors are kept. If running multiple clusterings, 
the clusters will be combined and callLoops will output the most significant 
one based on overlaps. 

Similar to callPeaks, keys parameters are -eps and -minPts. For sharp-peak like 
interaction data, set -eps small such as 500,1000. For broad-peak like data, 
such as H3K27ac HiChIP, set -eps big as 1000,2000. For Hi-C and HiChIP data, 
bigger -minPts is also needed, such as 20,50. 

Please note that the blockDBSCAN implementation in cLoops2 is much more 
sensitive than cDBSCAN in cLoops, so the same parameters can generate quite 
different results. With -hic option, cDBSCAN will be used. 

Examples:
    1. call loops for Hi-TrAC/Trac-looping
        cLoops2 callLoops -d trac -o trac -eps 200,500,1000,2000 -minPts 5 -w -j

                          -cut 1000 -max_cut -w -j

    3. call loops for Hi-TrAC/Trac-looping and get the PETs with any end 
       overlapping loop anchors
        cLoops2 callLoops -d trac -o trac -eps 200,500,1000,2000 -minPts 5 -w \
                          -j -filterPETs

        cLoops2 callLoops -d hic -o hic -eps 2000,5000,10000 -minPts 20,50 -w -j
    
    5. call inter-chromosomal loops (for most data, there will be no significant 
       inter-chromosomal loops)
        cLoops2 callLoops -d HiC -eps 5000 -minPts 10,20,50,100,200 -w -j -trans\

                  available. Too many CPU could cause out-of-memory problem if there are
                  too many PETs.

                  combined. No default value, please give the input.
  -minPts MINPTS  Points required in a cluster. minPts in blockDBSCAN is a key parameter.
                  Empirically 5 is good for TFs and histone modification ChIA-PET data

                  >=20. The input can be a series, and the final loops will have the
                  PETs>= max(minPts). 
  -plot           Whether to plot estimated inter-ligation and self-ligation PETs
                  distance distribution. Default is not to generate a plot.
  -i              Whether to convert loops to UCSC Interact track to visualize in UCSC.
                  Default is not, set this flag to save.
  -j              Whether to convert loops to 2D feature annotations to visualize in
                  Juicebox. Default is not, set this flag to save.
  -w              Whether to save tracks of loops to visualize in legacy and new washU.
                  Default is not, set this flag to save two files.
  -max_cut        When running cLoops with multiple eps or minPts, multiple distance
                  cutoffs for self-ligation and inter-ligation PETs will be estimated
                  based on the overlaps of anchors. Default option is the minimal one
                  will be used to filter PETs for candidate loop significance test.
                  Set this flag to use maximal one, will speed up for significance test.
  -hic            Whether to use statistical cutoffs for Hi-C to output significant loops.
                  Default is not, set this option to enable. Additionally, with -hic
                  option, there is no check for anchors requiring they looking like peaks.
  -filter         Whether to filter raw PETs according to called loops. The filtered
                  PETs can show clear view of interactions or be used to call loops again.
  -trans          Whether to call trans- (inter-chromosomal) loops. Default is not, set
                  this flag to call. For most common cases, not recommended, only for
                  data there are obvious visible trans loops.
  -emPair         By default eps and minPts combinations will be used to run clustering.
                  With this option, for example eps=500,1000 and minPts=5,10, only (500,5)
                  and (1000,10) as parameters of clustering will be run. Input number of
                  eps and minPts should be same.

### 12. Call differentially enriched intra-chromosomal loops
Run **cLoops2 callDiffLoops -h** to see details.
```
Call differentially enriched intra-chromosomal loops between two conditions.

Similar to calling peaks with control data, calling differentially enriched 
loops is based on scaled PETs and the Poisson test. There are three main steps 
in the algorithm: 1) merge the overlapped loops, quantify them and their 
permutated local background regions; 2) fit the linear transformation of 
background target interaction density to control background data based on 
MANorm2; therefore, if there are more than than two samples, others can be 
scaled to the reference sample for quantitative comparison; 3) estimate the 
fold change (M) cutoff and average (A) cutoff using the background data with 
the control of FDR, assuming there should no differentially significant 
interactions called from the background data; or using the assigned cutoffs; 4) 
estimate the significance based on the Poisson test for transformed data, both 
for the loop and loop anchors. For example, if transformed PETs for target is 
5, PETs for control is 3 while control nearby permutated background median is 
4, then for the Poisson test, lambda=4-1 is used to test the observed 5 to call
p-value.

### 16. Aggregation analysis for peaks, loops and domains
Run **cLoops2 agg -h** to see details.
```
Do the aggregation analysis for peaks, loops, view points and domains.

The output figures can be used directly, and the data to generate the plot are 
also saved for further customized analysis. 

For the aggregated peaks analysis,input is a .bed file annotated with the 
coordinates for the target regions/peaks/anchors. Output is a .pdf file 
containing a mean density plot and heatmap and a .txt file for the data. The 
data in the .txt file and plot were normalized to RPM (reads per million).

For the aggregated view points analysis, input is a .bed file annotated with 
coordinates for the target regions/peaks/anchors as view point. Output is a 
.pdf file containing a mean density plot and heatmap and a .txt file for the 
data. The data in the .txt file and plot were normalized to 
log2( RPM (reads per million)+1).

For the aggregated loops analysis, input is a _loops.txt file annotated with 
the coordinates for target loops, similar to the format of BEDPE. Output is a 
.pdf file for mean heatmap and .npz file generated through numpy.savez for all 
loops and nearby regions matrix. The enrichment score (ES) in the plot is 
calculated as: ES = mean( (PETs in loop)/(mean PETs of nearby regions) ). Other 
files except _loops.txt can be used as input, as long as the file contains key 
information in the first columns separated by tabs:
loopId	chrA	startA	endA	chrB	startB	endB	distance
loop-1	chr21	1000	2000	chr21	8000	9000	7000

There is another option for loops analysis, termed as two anchors. Input file is 
same to aggregated loops analysis. The whole region with assigned extesion
between two anchors will be aggregated and 1D profile can show two anchors. The 
analysis could be usefule to study/comapre different classes of anchors and 
combinations, for example, considering CTCT motif directions, all left anchors
CTCF motifs are in positive strand and in negative strand for all right anchors. 
It could be interesting for some loops one anchor only bound by transcription 
factor a and another anchor only bound by transcription b. 

For the aggregated domains analysis, input is a .bed file annotated with the
coordinates for the domains, such as TADs. Output are a .pdf file for the upper 
triangular heatmap and .npz file generated through numpy.savez for all domains 
and nearby region matrix. The enrichment score (ES) in the plot is calculated 
as mean( (two ends both with in domain PETs number)/( only one end in domain 
PETs number) ).

### 18. Annotation of loops to genes 
Run **cLoops2 anaLoops -h** to see details.
```
Annotating loops:
- find the closest TSS for each loop anchors
- merge the loop anchors and classify them as enhancers or promoters based on 
  distance to nearest TSS
- build the interaction networks for merged anchors 
- find the all interacted enhancers/promoters for each promoter  

Basic mode 1: with -gtf, loops will be annotated as enhancer or promoter based 
on distance to nearest gene. If a anchor overlapped with two/multiple promoters
(often seen for close head-to-head genes), all will be reported. If no TSS 
overlaps, then nearest one will be assigned.  

Basic mode 2: with -gtf -net, overlapped anchors will be merged and annoated as 
enhancer or promoter considering distance to genes. For each promoter, all 
linked enhancer and promoter will be shown. If there are more than 3 direct or 
indirect enhancers for a promoter, HITS algorithm will be used to identify one
hub for indirect enhancer and one hub for indirect enhancer. 

Examples:
    1. annotate loops for target gene, basic mode 1
        cLoops2 anaLoops -loops test_loops.txt -gtf genecode.gtf
    
    2. annotate loops for target transcripts (alternative TSS), basic mode 1
        cLoops2 anaLoops -loops test_loops.txt -gtf genecode.gtf -tid
    
    3. find a gene's all linked enhancer or promoter, basic mode 2

## Questions & Answers
There are two ways to ask questions or report bugs and get help: 
- Create a new [issue](https://github.com/YaqiangCao/cLoops2/issues).
- Please address questions and bugs to Yaqiang Cao (caoyaqiang0410@gmail.com or yaqiang.cao@nih.gov) using subject headers of "cLoops2: questions about ###" to avoid being filtered as spams.

Following are selected questions:

1. What is the difference between cLoops and cLoops2?    
The differences are listed as following:    
    - cLoops2 is based on a new clustering algorithm, which is more sensitive and efficient than the one used in cLoops to call loops or peaks.
    - cLoops2 is based on new data structure for paired-end reads, loops and peaks, code is better organized and more efficient than cLoops. 
    - cLoops2 can do a lot more than cLoops for the core algorithm 'loop-calling', including but not limited to peak-calling, loop-calling, differential enriched loop-calling.    
    - cLoops2 implemented lots of scripts for practical analysis of 3D genomic interaction data, such as loops visualization, loops quantification and data similarity comparison and etc.
    - cLoops2 is more focused on "enriched" interaction data. 

1. When to use cLoops2 to call peaks instead of MACS2/HOMER/SICER and others?    
Whenever the library is paired-end, or other tools failed to detect visually observed reliable peaks in IGV/washU/UCSC (which is true for some next-generation ChIP-seq -likes data). Or you want to customize your criteria for calling peaks.       
If only single-end data available, [getBedpeFBed.py](https://github.com/YaqiangCao/cLoops2/blob/master/scripts/getBedpeFBed.py) can help to generate the paired-end BEDPE file by extension of the reads. 

1. How does cLoops2 determine the output loops when there are multiple eps and minPts as parameters?      
For example, eps=5000,7500,10000 and minPts=5,10,20, there will be 9 clustering carried out to find potential loop regions, candidate with PETs less than max(minPts) (here 20) will be filtered. Further, for overlapped loops, after the significance test, cLoops2 will output the one with highest density. The reasons for multiple clusterings with eps and minPts are: 1) though DBSCAN clustering (or other) is great, there will be some stochasticity result due to the visit order for points, even though we try to control it; 2) Even though we implemented a theory estimation method for eps (cLoops2 estEps), there is actually no ideal theory estimation of parameters for the 3D genomic interaction data. 3) Hi-C or other kinds of data quality may vary a lot.
