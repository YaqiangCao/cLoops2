        ## Introduction
        cLoops2 is an extension of our previous work, [cLoops](https://github.com/YaqiangCao/cLoops). From loop-calling based on assumption-free clustering to a full suite of analysis tools for 3D genomic interaction data, cLoops2 has been adapted specifically for data such as Hi-TrAC/Trac-looping, for which interactions are enriched over the genome through experimental steps. cLoops2 still supports Hi-C -like data, of which the interaction signals are evenly distributed at enzyme cutting sites.  The changes from cLoops to cLoops2 are designed to address challenges around aiming for higher resolutions with the next-generation of genome architecture mapping technologies. 
        
        cLoops2 is designed with respect reference to [bedtools](https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Samtools](http://www.htslib.org/) for command-line style programming. If you have experience with them, you will find cLoops2 easy and efficient to use and combine commands, integrate as steps in your processing pipeline. 
        
        Please refer to our [Hi-TrAC method manuscript]() or [cLoops2 manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.20.453068v1) for what cLoops2 can do and show. 
        
        If you use cLoops2 in your research (the idea, the algorithm, the analysis scripts or the supplemental data), please give us a star on the GitHub repo page and cite our paper as follows:

        ```
        
        ------
        ### 1. Quality control for BEDPE files
        Run **cLoops2 qc -h** to see details. 
        ```
        Get the basic quality control statistical information from interaction BEDPE
        files.
        
        Example: 
            cLoops2 qc -f trac_rep1.bedpe.gz,trac_rep2.bedpe,trac_rep3.bedpe.gz -p 3 \
                       -o trac_stat
            
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help  show this help message and exit
          -d PREDIR   Assign data directory generated by cLoops2 pre to carry out analysis. 
          -o FNOUT    Output data directory / file name prefix, default is cLoops2_output.
          -p CPU      CPUs used to run the job, default is 1, set -1 to use all CPUs
                      available. Too many CPU could cause out-of-memory problem if there are
                      too many PETs.
          -cut CUT    Distance cutoff to filter cis PETs, only keep PETs with distance
                      >=cut. Default is 0, no filtering.
          -mcut MCUT  Keep the PETs with distance <=mcut. Default is -1, no filtering.
          -v          Show cLoops2 verison number and exit.
          ---         Following are sub-commands specific options. This option just show
                      version of cLoops2.
          -f FNIN     Input BEDPE file(s), .bedpe and .bedpe.gz are both suitable. Multiple
                      samples can be assigned as -f A.bedpe.gz,B.bedpe.gz,C.bedpe.gz.
        ```
        
        ------
        ### 2. Pre-process BEDPE into cLoops2 data
        Run **cLoops2 pre -h** to see details. 
        ```
        Preprocess mapped PETs into cLoops2 data files.
        
        Support input file formats:
        BEDPE: https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/general-usage.html 
        PAIRS: https://pairtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/formats.html#pairs
        
        The output directory contains one .json file for the basic statistics of PETs 
        information and .ixy files which are coordinates for every PET. The coordinate
        files will be used to call peaks, loops or any other analyses implemented in 
        cLoops2. For data backup/sharing purposes, the directory can be saved as 
        .tar.gz file through tar. If changed and moved location, run 
        ***cLoops2 update -d*** to update.
        
        Examples:
            1. keep high quality PETs of chromosome chr21
                cLoops2 pre -f trac_rep1.bepee.gz,trac_rep2.bedpe.gz -o trac -c chr21
        
            2. keep all cis PETs that have distance > 1kb
                cLoops2 pre -f trac_rep1.bedpe.gz,trac_rep2.bedpe.gz -o trac -mapq 0
        
            
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
          -d PREDIR             Assign data directory generated by cLoops2 pre to carry out analysis. 
          -o FNOUT              Output data directory / file name prefix, default is cLoops2_output.
          -p CPU                CPUs used to run the job, default is 1, set -1 to use all CPUs
                                available. Too many CPU could cause out-of-memory problem if there are
                                too many PETs.
          -cut CUT              Distance cutoff to filter cis PETs, only keep PETs with distance
                                >=cut. Default is 0, no filtering.
          -mcut MCUT            Keep the PETs with distance <=mcut. Default is -1, no filtering.
          -v                    Show cLoops2 verison number and exit.
          ---                   Following are sub-commands specific options. This option just show
                                version of cLoops2.
          -f FNIN               Input BEDPE or PAIR file(s), .bedpe and .bedpe.gz are both suitable.
                                Replicates or multiple samples can be assigned as -f A.bedpe.gz,
                                B.bedpe.gz,C.bedpe.gz to get merged PETs.
          -c CHROMS             Argument to process limited set of chromosomes, specify it as chr1,
                                chr2,chr3. Use this option to filter reads from such as
                                chr22_KI270876v1. The default setting is to use the entire set of
                                chromosomes from the data.
          -trans                Whether to parse trans- (inter-chromosomal) PETs. The default is to
                                ignore trans-PETs. Set this flag to pre-process all PETs.
          -mapq MAPQ            MAPQ cutoff to filter raw PETs, default is >=10. This option is not
                                valid when input is .pairs file.
          -format {bedpe,pairs}
                                cLoops2 currently supports BEDPE and PAIRs file format. Default is bedpe.
        ```
        
        ------
        ### 3. Update cLoops2 data directory
        Run **cLoops2 update -h** to see details. 
        ```
        Update cLoops2 data files generated by **cLoops2 pre**.
        
        In the **cLoops2 pre** output directory, there is a .json file annotated with 
        the .ixy **absolute paths** and other information. So if the directory is 
        moved, or some .ixy files are removed or changed, this command is needed to 
        update the paths, otherwise the other analysis modules will not work.
        
        Example:
            cLoops2 update -d ./Trac
            
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help  show this help message and exit
          -d PREDIR   Assign data directory generated by cLoops2 pre to carry out analysis. 
          -o FNOUT    Output data directory / file name prefix, default is cLoops2_output.
          -p CPU      CPUs used to run the job, default is 1, set -1 to use all CPUs
                      available. Too many CPU could cause out-of-memory problem if there are
                      too many PETs.
          -cut CUT    Distance cutoff to filter cis PETs, only keep PETs with distance
                      >=cut. Default is 0, no filtering.
          -mcut MCUT  Keep the PETs with distance <=mcut. Default is -1, no filtering.
          -v          Show cLoops2 verison number and exit.
          ---         Following are sub-commands specific options. This option just show
                      version of cLoops2.
        ```
        
        ------
        ### 4. Convert cLoops2 data to others    
        Run **cLoops2 dump -h** to see details.   
        ```
        Convert cLoops2 data files to other types. Currently supports BED file,BEDPE 
        file, HIC file, washU long-range track, bedGraph file and matrix txt file. 
        
        Converting cLoops2 data to .hic file needs "juicer_tools pre" in the command
        line enviroment. 
        Converting cLoops2 data to legacy washU browser long-range track needs bgzip
        and tabix. Format reference: http://wiki.wubrowse.org/Long-range. 
        Converting cLoops2 data to UCSC bigInteract track needs bedToBigBed. Format 
        reference: https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/interact.html.
        Converting cLoops2 data to bedGraph track will normalize value as RPM 
        (reads per million). Run with -bdg_pe flag for 1D data such as ChIC-seq,
        ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq. 
        Converting cLoops2 data to matrix txt file will need specific resolution. 
        The output txt file can be loaded in TreeView for visualization or further
        analysis. 
        
        Examples:
            1. convert cLoops2 data to single-end .bed file fo usage of BEDtools or 
               MACS2 for peak-calling with close PETs
                cLoops2 dump -d trac -o trac -bed -mcut 1000
        
            2. convert cLoops2 data to .bedpe file for usage of BEDtools, only keep 
               PETs distance >1kb and < 1Mb
                cLoops2 dump -d trac -o trac -bedpe -bedpe_ext -cut 1000 -mcut 1000000

        ### 5. Estimate eps
        Run **cLoops2 estEps -h** to see details. 
        ```
        Estimate key parameter eps. 
        
        Two methods are implemented: 1) unsupervised Gaussian mixture model (gmm), and 
        2) k-distance plot (k-dis,-k needed). Gmm is based on the assumption that PETs 
        can be classified into self-ligation (peaks) and inter-ligation (loops). K-dis
        is based on the k-nearest neighbors distance distribution to find the "knee", 
        which is where the distance (eps) between neighbors has a sharp increase along
        the k-distance curve. K-dis is the traditional approach literatures, but it is
        much more time consuming than gmm, and maybe only fit to small cases. If both 
        methods do not give nice plots, please turn to the empirical parameters you 
        like, such as 100,200 for ChIP-seq -like data, 5000,1000 for Hi-C and etc.
        
        Examples: 
            1. estimate eps with Gaussian mixture model    
                cLoops2 estEps -d trac -o trac_estEps_gmm -p 10 -method gmm

          -p CPU               CPUs used to run the job, default is 1, set -1 to use all CPUs
                               available. Too many CPU could cause out-of-memory problem if there are
                               too many PETs.

                               generated by cLoops2 pre. For very large data, especially Hi-C, this
                               option is recommended for chr1 (or the smaller one) to save time.
          -k KNN               The k-nearest neighbors used to draw the k-distance plot. Default is 0
                               (not running), set this when -method k-dis. Suggested 5 for
                               ChIA-PET/Trac-looping data, 20 or 30 for Hi-C like data.
          -method {gmm,k-dis}  Two methods can be chosen to estimate eps. Default is Gmm. See above
                               for difference of the methods.
        
        ```
        
        ------
        ### 6. Estimate reasonable contact matrix resolution 
        Run **cLoops2 estRes -h** to see details. 
        ```
        Estimate reasonable genome-wide contact matrix resolution based on signal 
        enrichment. 
        
        PETs will be assigned to contact matrix bins according to input resolution. A 
        bin is marked as [nx,ny], and a PET is assigned to a bin by nx = int((x-s)/bs),
        ny = int((y-s)/bs), where s is the minimal coordinate for all PETs and bs is 
        the bin size. Self-interaction bins (nx=ny) will be ignored. The bins only 
        containing singleton PETs are assumed as noise. 
        
        The output is a PDF plot, for each resolution, a line is separated into two 
        parts: 1) dash line indicated linear increased trend of singleton PETs/bins; 2)
        solid thicker line indicated non-linear increased trend of higher potential 
        signal PETs/bins. The higher the ratio of signal PETs/bins, the easier it it to
        find loops in that resolution. The closer to the random line, the higher the 
        possibility to observe evenly distributed signals.  
        
        We expect the highest resolution with >=50% PETs are not singletons.
        
        Example:
            cLoops2 estRes -d trac -o trac -bs 10000,5000,1000 -p 20

          -p CPU       CPUs used to run the job, default is 1, set -1 to use all CPUs
                       available. Too many CPU could cause out-of-memory problem if there are
                       too many PETs.
          -cut CUT     Distance cutoff to filter cis PETs, only keep PETs with distance
                       >=cut. Default is 0, no filtering.

                       be used as input. For example,-bs 1000,5000,10000. Default is 5000.

        ### 8. Filter PETs    
        Run **cLoops2 filterPETs -h** to see details 
        ```
        Filter PETs according to peaks/domains/loops/singletons/KNNs. 
        
        If any end of the PETs overlap with features such as peaks or loops, the PET 
        will be kept. Filtering can be done before or after peak/loop-calling. Input 
        can be peaks or loops, but should not be be mixed. The -singleton mode is based
        on a specified contact matrix resolution, if there is only one PET in the bin, 
        the singleton PETs will be filtered. The -knn is based on noise removing step 
        of blockDBSCAN. 
        
        Examples:
            1. keep PETs overlapping with peaks
                cLoops2 filterPETs -d trac -peaks peaks.bed -o trac_filtered
        
            2. keep PETs that do not overlap with any blacklist regions

                cLoops2 filterPETs -d trac -loops test_loops.txt -o trac_filtered
        
            4. keep PETs that both ends overlap with loop anchors
                cLoops2 filterPETs -d trac -loops test_loops.txt -o trac_filtered -both
        
            5. keep non-singleton PETs based on 1kb contact matrix
                cLoops2 filterPETs -d trac -o trac_filtered -singleton -bs 1000
        
            6. filter PETs based on blockDBSCAN knn noise removing

        ### 9. Sampling PETs     
        Run **cLoops2 samplePETs -h** to see details.
        ```
        Sampling PETs to target total size. 
        
        If there are multiple sample libraries and the total sequencing depths vary a 
        lot, and you want to compare the data fairly, it's better to sample them to 
        similar total PETs (either down-sampling or up-sampling), then call peaks/loops
        with the same parameters. 
        
        Example:
            cLoops2 samplePETs -d trac -o trac_sampled -tot 5000000 -p 10
            
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help  show this help message and exit
          -d PREDIR   Assign data directory generated by cLoops2 pre to carry out analysis. 
          -o FNOUT    Output data directory / file name prefix, default is cLoops2_output.
          -p CPU      CPUs used to run the job, default is 1, set -1 to use all CPUs
                      available. Too many CPU could cause out-of-memory problem if there are
                      too many PETs.
          -cut CUT    Distance cutoff to filter cis PETs, only keep PETs with distance
                      >=cut. Default is 0, no filtering.
          -mcut MCUT  Keep the PETs with distance <=mcut. Default is -1, no filtering.
          -v          Show cLoops2 verison number and exit.
          ---         Following are sub-commands specific options. This option just show
                      version of cLoops2.
          -tot TOT    Target total number of PETs.
        ```

        ### 10. Call peaks for 1D or 3D data
        Run **cLoops2 callPeaks -h** to see details.
        ```
        Call peaks based on clustering. 
        
        Well tested work for ChIP-seq, ChIC-seq, ATAC-seq, CUT&RUN -like or the 3D
        genomic data such as Hi-TrAC/Trac-looping, ChIA-PET and HiChIP.
        
        There are three steps in the algorithm: 1) cluster the PETs to find 
        self-ligation clusters, which are candidate peaks; 2) estimate the significance
        of candidate peaks with local background; 3) if given control data, further 
        compare candidate peaks to control data. If running multiple clusterings with
        separated parameters, the clusters will be combined and callPeaks will output 
        the most significant one based on overlaps. 
        
        Key parameters are -eps and -minPts, both are key parameters in the clustering
        algorithm blockDBSCAN. Eps indicates the distance that define two points (PETs) 
        being neighbors, while minPts indicatess the minial number of points required 
        for a cluster to form.  For sharp-peak like data (ATAC-seq, TF ChIC-seq), set
        -eps small such as 100 or 150. For broad-peak like data, such as H3K27me3 
        ChIP-seq and ChIC-seq, set -eps large as 500 or 1000. 
        
        Eps will affect more than minPts for sensitivity.
        
        Examples:
            1. call peaks for Trac-looping  
                cLoops2 callPeaks -d trac -eps 100 -minPts 10 -o trac -p 10
        
            2. call peaks for sharp-peak like ChIC-seq without control data
                cLoops2 callPeaks -d ctcf_chic -o ctcf_chic -p 10
        
            3. call peaks for broad-peak like ChIC-seq with IgG as control
                cLoops2 callPeaks -d H3K27me3 -bgd IgG -eps 500,1000 -minPts 10 \
                                  -o H3K27me3 
        
            4. call peaks for sharp-peak ChIC-seq with linear fitting scaled control 
               data
                cLoops2 callPeaks -d ctcf -bgd IgG -eps 150 -minPts 10 -o ctcf -p 10\
                                  -bgm lf
        
            5. call peaks with sentitive mode to get comprehensive peaks for CUT&TAG
                cLoops2 callPeaks -d H3K27ac -bgd IgG -sen -p 10
        
            6. filter PETs first and then call peaks for H3K27ac HiChIP, resulting much
               much accurate peaks
                cLoops2 filterPETs -d h3k27ac_hichip -o h3k27ac_hichip_filtered -knn \
                                   -eps 500 -minPts 5
                cLoops2 callPeaks -d h3k27ac_hichip_filtered -eps 200,500 -minPts 10 \
                                  -p 10
        
            7. call peaks for interaction data as single-end data 
                cLoops2 callPeaks -d h3k27ac -o h3k27ac -split -eps 200,500 -minPts 10 \
                                  -p 10
        
            8. call differential peaks between WT and KO condition
                cLoops2 callPeaks -d MLL4_WT -bgd MLL4_KO -o MLL4_WTvsKO -p 10
                cLoops2 callPeaks -d MLL4_KO -bgd MLL4_WT -o MLL4_KOvsWT -p 10
            
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help          show this help message and exit
          -d PREDIR           Assign data directory generated by cLoops2 pre to carry out analysis. 
          -o FNOUT            Output data directory / file name prefix, default is cLoops2_output.
          -p CPU              CPUs used to run the job, default is 1, set -1 to use all CPUs
                              available. Too many CPU could cause out-of-memory problem if there are
                              too many PETs.
          -cut CUT            Distance cutoff to filter cis PETs, only keep PETs with distance
                              >=cut. Default is 0, no filtering.
          -mcut MCUT          Keep the PETs with distance <=mcut. Default is -1, no filtering.
          -v                  Show cLoops2 verison number and exit.
          ---                 Following are sub-commands specific options. This option just show
                              version of cLoops2.
          -eps EPS            Distance that defines two points (PETs) being neighbors, eps in
                              blockDBSCAN as key parameter, multiple eps can be assigned such as
                              100,200,300 to run multiple clusterings, the results will be combined.
                              For callPeaks, the default is 100,200. If the data show much more broad
                              feature such as H3K27me3 and H3K4me1, increase it to 500,1000 or larger.
                              If expecting both narrow and broad peaks in the data, set -eps 100,200,
                              500,1000.
          -minPts MINPTS      Points required in a cluster, minPts in blockDBSCAN, key parameter,
                              multiple minPts can be assigned such as 3,5 to run multiple
                              clusterings, the results will be combined. For callPeaks, the default
                              is 5. If the data have many reads, increasing minPts such as 10,20.
          -pcut PCUT          Bonferroni corrected poisson p-value cutoff to determine significant
                              peaks. Default is 1e-2.
          -bgd BGD            Assign control data (IgG, Input) directory generated by cLoops2 pre to
                              carry out analysis. Default is no background.
          -bgm {ratio,lf}     How to scale the target data with control data. Available options are
                              'ratio' and 'lf'. 'ratio' is based on library size and 'lf' means
                              linear fitting for control and target candidate peaks nearby regions.
                              Default is 'lf'. The scaling factor estimated by lf usually is a little
                              larger than ratio. In other words, the higher the scaling factor, the
                              less sensitive the results.
          -pseudo PSEUDO      Pseudo counts for local background or control data to estimate the
                              significance of peaks if no PETs/reads in the background. Default is
                              1. Set it larger for noisy data, 0 is recommend for very clean data
                              such as well prepared CUT&Tag.
          -sen                Whether to use sensitive mode to call peaks. Default is not. If only a
                              few peaks were called, while a lot more can be observed
                              from visualization, try this option. Adjust -pcut or filter by
                              yourself to select significant ones.
          -split              Whether to split paired-end as single end data to call peaks. Sometimes
                              works well for Trac-looping and HiChIP.
          -splitExt SPLITEXT  When run with -split, the extension to upstraem and downstream, 
                              default is 50.
        ```

        ### 11. Call loops
        Run **cLoops2 callLoops -h** to see details.
        ```
        Call loops based on clustering. 
        
        Well tested work for Hi-TrAC/TrAC-looping, HiCHiP, ChIA-PET and Hi-C.
        
        Similar to call peaks, there are three main steps in the algorithm: 1) cluster 
        the PETs to find inter-ligation clusters, which are candidate loops; 2) 
        estimate the significance of candidate loops with permutated local background. 
        3) If -hic option not selected, the loop anchors will be checked for peak-like 
        features, only peak-like anchors are kept. If running multiple clusterings, 
        the clusters will be combined and callLoops will output the most significant 
        one based on overlaps. 
        
        Similar to callPeaks, keys parameters are -eps and -minPts. For sharp-peak like 
        interaction data, set -eps small such as 500,1000. For broad-peak like data, 
        such as H3K27ac HiChIP, set -eps big as 1000,2000. For Hi-C and HiChIP data, 
        bigger -minPts is also needed, such as 20,50. 
        
        Please note that the blockDBSCAN implementation in cLoops2 is much more 
        sensitive than cDBSCAN in cLoops, so the same parameters can generate quite 
        different results. With -hic option, cDBSCAN will be used. 
        
        Examples:
            1. call loops for Hi-TrAC/Trac-looping
                cLoops2 callLoops -d trac -o trac -eps 200,500,1000,2000 -minPts 5 -w -j

            5. call inter-chromosomal loops (for most data, there will be no significant 
               inter-chromosomal loops)
                cLoops2 callLoops -d HiC -eps 5000 -minPts 10,20,50,100,200 -w -j -trans\

          -o FNOUT        Output data directory / file name prefix, default is cLoops2_output.
          -p CPU          CPUs used to run the job, default is 1, set -1 to use all CPUs
                          available. Too many CPU could cause out-of-memory problem if there are
                          too many PETs.
          -cut CUT        Distance cutoff to filter cis PETs, only keep PETs with distance
                          >=cut. Default is 0, no filtering.
          -mcut MCUT      Keep the PETs with distance <=mcut. Default is -1, no filtering.
          -v              Show cLoops2 verison number and exit.

                          blockDBSCAN as key parameter, multiple eps can be assigned such as
                          200,500,1000,2000 to run multiple clusterings, the results will be
                          combined. No default value, please give the input.
          -minPts MINPTS  Points required in a cluster. minPts in blockDBSCAN is a key parameter.
                          Empirically 5 is good for TFs and histone modification ChIA-PET data
                          and Trac-looping. For data like HiChIP and Hi-C, set it larger, like
                          >=20. The input can be a series, and the final loops will have the
                          PETs>= max(minPts). 
          -plot           Whether to plot estimated inter-ligation and self-ligation PETs
                          distance distribution. Default is not to generate a plot.
          -i              Whether to convert loops to UCSC Interact track to visualize in UCSC.
                          Default is not, set this flag to save.
          -j              Whether to convert loops to 2D feature annotations to visualize in
                          Juicebox. Default is not, set this flag to save.
          -w              Whether to save tracks of loops to visualize in legacy and new washU.
                          Default is not, set this flag to save two files.
          -max_cut        When running cLoops with multiple eps or minPts, multiple distance
                          cutoffs for self-ligation and inter-ligation PETs will be estimated
                          based on the overlaps of anchors. Default option is the minimal one
                          will be used to filter PETs for candidate loop significance test.
                          Set this flag to use maximal one, will speed up for significance test.
          -hic            Whether to use statistical cutoffs for Hi-C to output significant loops.
                          Default is not, set this option to enable. Additionally, with -hic
                          option, there is no check for anchors requiring they looking like peaks.
          -filter         Whether to filter raw PETs according to called loops. The filtered
                          PETs can show clear view of interactions or be used to call loops again.
          -trans          Whether to call trans- (inter-chromosomal) loops. Default is not, set
                          this flag to call. For most common cases, not recommended, only for
                          data there are obvious visible trans loops.
          -emPair         By default eps and minPts combinations will be used to run clustering.
                          With this option, for example eps=500,1000 and minPts=5,10, only (500,5)
                          and (1000,10) as parameters of clustering will be run. Input number of
                          eps and minPts should be same.

        ### 12. Call differentially enriched intra-chromosomal loops
        Run **cLoops2 callDiffLoops -h** to see details.
        ```
        Call differentially enriched intra-chromosomal loops between two conditions.
        
        Similar to calling peaks with control data, calling differentially enriched 
        loops is based on scaled PETs and the Poisson test. There are three main steps 
        in the algorithm: 1) merge the overlapped loops, quantify them and their 
        permutated local background regions; 2) fit the linear transformation of 
        background target interaction density to control background data based on 
        MANorm2; therefore, if there are more than than two samples, others can be 
        scaled to the reference sample for quantitative comparison; 3) estimate the 
        fold change (M) cutoff and average (A) cutoff using the background data with 
        the control of FDR, assuming there should no differentially significant 
        interactions called from the background data; or using the assigned cutoffs; 4) 
        estimate the significance based on the Poisson test for transformed data, both 
        for the loop and loop anchors. For example, if transformed PETs for target is 
        5, PETs for control is 3 while control nearby permutated background median is 
        4, then for the Poisson test, lambda=4-1 is used to test the observed 5 to call
        p-value.

        ------
        ### 16. Aggregation analysis for peaks, loops and domains
        Run **cLoops2 agg -h** to see details.
        ```
        Do the aggregation analysis for peaks, loops, view points and domains.
        
        The output figures can be used directly, and the data to generate the plot are 
        also saved for further customized analysis. 
        
        For the aggregated peaks analysis,input is a .bed file annotated with the 
        coordinates for the target regions/peaks/anchors. Output is a .pdf file 
        containing a mean density plot and heatmap and a .txt file for the data. The 
        data in the .txt file and plot were normalized to RPM (reads per million).
        
        For the aggregated view points analysis, input is a .bed file annotated with 
        coordinates for the target regions/peaks/anchors as view point. Output is a 
        .pdf file containing a mean density plot and heatmap and a .txt file for the 
        data. The data in the .txt file and plot were normalized to 
        log2( RPM (reads per million)+1).
        
        For the aggregated loops analysis, input is a _loops.txt file annotated with 
        the coordinates for target loops, similar to the format of BEDPE. Output is a 
        .pdf file for mean heatmap and .npz file generated through numpy.savez for all 
        loops and nearby regions matrix. The enrichment score (ES) in the plot is 
        calculated as: ES = mean( (PETs in loop)/(mean PETs of nearby regions) ). Other 
        files except _loops.txt can be used as input, as long as the file contains key 
        information in the first columns separated by tabs:
        loopId	chrA	startA	endA	chrB	startB	endB	distance
        loop-1	chr21	1000	2000	chr21	8000	9000	7000
        
        There is another option for loops analysis, termed as two anchors. Input file is 
        same to aggregated loops analysis. The whole region with assigned extesion
        between two anchors will be aggregated and 1D profile can show two anchors. The 
        analysis could be usefule to study/comapre different classes of anchors and 
        combinations, for example, considering CTCT motif directions, all left anchors
        CTCF motifs are in positive strand and in negative strand for all right anchors. 
        It could be interesting for some loops one anchor only bound by transcription 
        factor a and another anchor only bound by transcription b. 
        
        For the aggregated domains analysis, input is a .bed file annotated with the
        coordinates for the domains, such as TADs. Output are a .pdf file for the upper 
        triangular heatmap and .npz file generated through numpy.savez for all domains 
        and nearby region matrix. The enrichment score (ES) in the plot is calculated 
        as mean( (two ends both with in domain PETs number)/( only one end in domain 
        PETs number) ).

        ### 18. Annotation of loops to genes 
        Run **cLoops2 anaLoops -h** to see details.
        ```
        Annotating loops:
        - find the closest TSS for each loop anchors
        - merge the loop anchors and classify them as enhancers or promoters based on 
          distance to nearest TSS
        - build the interaction networks for merged anchors 
        - find the all interacted enhancers/promoters for each promoter  
        
        Basic mode 1: with -gtf, loops will be annotated as enhancer or promoter based 
        on distance to nearest gene. If a anchor overlapped with two/multiple promoters
        (often seen for close head-to-head genes), all will be reported. If no TSS 
        overlaps, then nearest one will be assigned.  
        
        Basic mode 2: with -gtf -net, overlapped anchors will be merged and annoated as 
        enhancer or promoter considering distance to genes. For each promoter, all 
        linked enhancer and promoter will be shown. If there are more than 3 direct or 
        indirect enhancers for a promoter, HITS algorithm will be used to identify one
        hub for indirect enhancer and one hub for indirect enhancer.

        1th | PromoterTarget  | promoter target genes. If a promoter is shared by multiple genes, all genes will be reported and seperated by comma. For example, chr21:34787801-35049344\|-\|RUNX1 (named by the rule of: chorm:start-end\|strand\|name.
        2th | directEnhancer  | enhancers that directly looping with target promoter. Multiple enhancers will be reported and seperated by comma. For example, chr21:35075636-35077527\|Enhancer,chr21:35026356-35028520\|Enhancer,chr21:34801302-34805056\|Enhancer.
        3th | indirectEnhancer  | enhancers that indirectly looping with target promoter, by enhancer-enhancer-promoter or enhancer-promoter-promoter. Multiple enhancers will be reported and seperated by comma.
        4th | directPromoter  | other promoters directly looping with target promoter. 
        5th | indirectPromoter | other promoters indirectly looping with target promoter, by promoter-enhancer-promoter or promoter-promoter-promoter. 
        6th | directEnhancerHub | hub of direct enhancer. If there are more than 2 direct enhancers, using HITS algorithm to find the most linked one and report. 
        7th | indirectEnhancerHub | hub of indirect enhancer. If there are more than 2 indirect enhancers, using HITS algorithm to find the most linked one and report.
